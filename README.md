# 1greenweb-project is a tamplate created using html and css. 
As a trainee at conative it solutions private limited this is my first tamplate that my manager has given me to build and i have completed in a two working days using float. 
In this tamplate i have not used flexbox and responsive part of website. 
It was a great learning i have learned so many mistakes that i used to do as a student and it is going to be a great experience in IT industry.
